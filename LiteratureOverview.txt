Neuropsych - SAD paper Liv:
29 SAD, 30 HC

cognition features:

	* working memory -  Letter-number Sequencing task (LNS)
	* cognitive processing speed - the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT)
	* motor speed - Simple Reaction Time (SRT) Note: They log transformed (loge) SRT data, yielding normally distributed residuals.


all show a significant group difference

covariates: 

	* seasonal test order - summer-winter or winter-summer
	* age 
	* sex  
	* IQ in terms of RIST


Neuropsych - SAD paper Personality:
29 SAD, 30 HC

personality features from NEO Personality Inventory-Revised (NEO PI-R) :

	* Neuroticism 
	* Extraversion
	* Openness
	* Agreeableness
	* Conscientiousness


only significant for neuroticism; htere is a group by season interaction for extraversion and openness

PET - Brenda's Brain paper:
17 SAD, 23 HC

patients with seasonal affective disorder had higher serotonin transporter than the healthy control subjects (P = 0.01) in winter only!
global BPnd as defined as sum(bnpnd * volume)/total volume

signififcant group effect for seasonal chnage

covariates:

	* age
	* genotype
	* sex

There was a significant differences in the summer and winter measurements for healthy controls in inj. mass

fMRI - Camilla's paper:
17 SAD, 15 HC <- why are there so much fewer HCs?

Compared to healthy controls, SAD individuals showed significantly lower amygdala reactivity to all faces, independent of season, with no evidence for a season-by-group interaction

covariates:

	* scan order
	* age
	* sex
	* neuroticism
	* 
5-HTTLPR genotype



none of the covariates were significant though

Unpublished data from us:

17 SAD and 23 HC individuals have [11C]DASB PET scans at summer and winter

Martin and Brenda are currently looking at this.
