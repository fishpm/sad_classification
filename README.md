# Code repository for SAD classification

This is a code repository for the SAD classification project. The goal is to try and use our fMRI, PET and Neuropsych data on the SAD patients in order to predict SAD status

TO DO

Data:
1 Patrick will prepare fMRI data - F A N (or F+A-N) in amygdala left and right combined, show that Land R amygdalin are correlated, maybe basal lateral

2 Besides fMRI we will use the following data 
Pet data - extract from Peter's sheet
Thalamus, putamen, caudate as well as amygdala and hippo for dasb
putamen, caudate for SB
          Neocortex for both
          Volume data?
          Covariates - look at list, but need to kick out Httplr since that was used to recruit


Methodolody:

Classification 
Use all data available for each modality, use complete cases for combinding all modalities

Scans
a) Only Summer
b) Only Winter
c) 1st scan made 
d) Randomly pick one scan, summer or winter
